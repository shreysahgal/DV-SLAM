# DV-SLAM
ROB 530 Final Project Group 9: DV SLAM

This repository holds all the code for our NAVARCH/EECS 568, ROB530: Mobile Robotics final project. The title of our project is DV-SLAM. Team members are: Joshua Friesen, Shanzhao Wang, Shrey Sahgal, Yi-Cheng Lai, Yu-Min Jian (listed in alphabetical order)

## Main Idea and Objective
The main idea of our project is to enhance the performance of the visual odometry (VO) part in ORB-SLAM2 [[2]](#2) by a deep learning method. We plan to maintain the back-end structure of ORB-SLAM2 [[2]](#2) and only modify the visual odometry part of the front-end side. We use the monocular camera information from the KITTI dataset as the input data and replaced the VO algorithm with a pre-trained end-to-end DL-based model called DeepVO [[4]](#4).


### Running the code

In order to configure this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository onto your local system.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/shreysahgal/DV-SLAM.git
```
#### ORB-SLAM2

3. Run main_DV.py

### Requirements
* Python 3.8.10
* Numpy 1.22.3
* OpenCV 4.5.5
* Gtsam 4.1.1
* Matplotlib 3.4.3
* Tqdm 4.64.0

## Results

The results show a substantial improvement with loop closures when compared to pure Deep VO output. These results are from running our program on KITTI rgb odometry dataset 07. To replicate them follow the "Running the code" section below.

The results above show our DV-algorithm with a side by side comparison with ORB-SLAM modified by the Horn [[1]](#1) trajectory alignment algorithm. In comparison with a widely used monocular SLAM solution, ORB-SLAM2, our DV-SLAM does not perform as well across all metrics listed. However, we believe that the modification of other algorithm's front-ends, such as ORB-SLAM2, with the deepVO model has the potential to generate results surpassing either of the above methods. We leave this to future works.

To replicate the above results simply clone the repository, and run the deepVO_stats.py file and orb-slam alignment.py files. DeepVO_stats.py generates the error statistics and graph for DV-SLAM, and orb-slam alignment.py runs the results of ORB-SLAM through the Horn [[1]](#1) algorithm before before generating the error statistics and graph. All necessary files are provided. If you wish to generate your own, KeyFrameTrajectory.txt can be generated by running ORB-SLAM2 [[2]](#2) on the KITTI [[3]](#3) odometry dataset. The gtsam7.txt file (results of DV-SLAM) can be generated as follows.
